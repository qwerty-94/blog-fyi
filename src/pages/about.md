I work towards advocating for policies and technologies that promote privacy and protect individuals from invasive surveillance.
Furthermore, I believe that technology has the potential to promote and protect human rights. From fighting against censorship to promoting freedom of speech, technology can be a powerful tool for advancing social justice causes.
